# Work in Progress

## Motivation

* foobar2000 is an excellent music player that meets most of my requirements. However, it lacks a dedicated Linux desktop version (although it can be run through Wine), and its macOS version is not fully featured. While DeaDBeeF is a viable alternative, it falls short in terms of available plugins compared to foobar2000, particularly the foo_openlyrics plugin.
* Consequently, I decide to implement a music player that meet my needs. Hope that I can make a player that is both well written and provides good user experience.
